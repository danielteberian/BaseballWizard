Title of the Project: Predicting MLB Game Outcomes with Distributed Machine Learning

Type of Learning: Binary Classification

Machine Learning Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Approach for Parallelizing the Machine Learning Algorithm:
We parallelized the data processing and model training using PySpark's distributed computing framework. The approach focuses on utilizing Spark’s native parallelization for feature engineering, data transformations, and model training.
Spark’s MLlib was used for distributed model training, and dataset partitions were used to speed up data transformations and evaluations across nodes.
Description of the Dataset:
The dataset consists of MLB player statistics from games played in 2018-2024. It contains game-level data (e.g., scores, player performance) and player-specific stats (e.g., batting average, home runs, pitch speed).
